# Colors Lab Demo

This is a demo project for COP4331 to showcase a simulacrum of a git history. As this git assignment was given after the original assignment was due, the git history does not perfectly match a natural one. However, aside from a larger-than-average commit size, the commits included mirror ones that I have done in solo and group projects.

The application itself is a LAMP stack project that allows a user to log in, save various colors, and then search for colors they have saved.

To run this application, set up an Apache webserver. Describing how to do so is beyond the scope of this README. Once that is done, clone the github repository into `/var/www/html`. Create a `.env` file to hold the server configuration. An example `.env` file is included in `.env.example`

Once the server is set up, connect to it via a web browser to the port specified in apache (default port 80 for http).

No AI was used in the creation of this repository. All code included was provided by the professor.
